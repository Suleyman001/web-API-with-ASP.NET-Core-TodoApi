# ASP.NET Core Web API Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core with a focus on CRUD operations, routing, and database integration. The API is designed for basic task management, providing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items in a database.

## Project Description
This ASP.NET Core Web API project is built using a controller-based approach and integrates with a database to store and manage data. The project demonstrates reliable API design patterns and includes support for authentication and deployment to cloud platforms such as Azure.

## Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you need:
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **Visual Studio Code**
- **.NET SDK** (version 6.0 or later)
- **SQL Server** or another compatible database
- **Postman** or another API testing tool for endpoint testing

## Project Setup
1. **Create the Project:** Start by creating a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.
2. **Add Packages:** Use NuGet to add necessary packages, such as `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` for database access.

## NuGet Packages
This project requires the following NuGet packages:
- **Entity Framework Core** - Enables database context and object-relational mapping.
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication** - Adds authentication mechanisms to secure the API.

Install packages via the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or using the command line.

## Database and Model
1. **Create Model Classes:** Define classes representing the database entities.
2. **Database Context:** Implement a database context that inherits from `DbContext` to manage interactions with the database.
3. **Database Configuration:** Register the database context in `Startup.cs` to enable dependency injection for database operations.

## Controller Scaffolding
1. **Generate Controllers:** Use Visual Studio scaffolding to automatically create controllers with actions (methods) for CRUD operations.
2. **Customize Methods:** Modify the generated methods, if necessary, to customize functionality for your application.

## HTTP Methods and Routing
- **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** methods are implemented to allow full CRUD functionality.
- **Routing**: Configure attribute-based routing to define API paths, making it easy to interact with the API from external applications.

### Example Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/items` - Retrieve a list of items
- **POST** `/api/items` - Add a new item
- **PUT** `/api/items/{id}` - Update an existing item
- **DELETE** `/api/items/{id}` - Delete an item

## Security and Validation
- **Prevent Overposting:** Ensure that only allowed properties are modified by implementing DTOs or view models.
- **Authentication**: Integrate JWT or other authentication methods to secure the API endpoints.

## JavaScript Integration
- **API Consumption:** Use JavaScript to call the API from a client application, demonstrating how frontend applications can interact with the API.
- **AJAX Requests:** Leverage AJAX for smooth, asynchronous operations between the client and API.

## Deployment
1. **Publish to Azure**: Configure and deploy the API to Azure for cloud-based access.
2. **Testing**: Ensure the API functions correctly in the cloud environment, adjusting configurations as necessary.

# To-Do CRUD Application

In last commit,Call an ASP.NET Core web API with JavaScript, I build an HTML page to manage to-do items via a web API. Event handlers trigger Fetch API requests for CRUD operations: 

- **GET** to retrieve items
- **POST** to add items
- **PUT** to update items
- **DELETE** to remove items

Responses update the page dynamically. Static file serving is configured in `Program.cs`, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files placed in the `wwwroot` folder. All interactions happen through HTTP requests to the `/api/todoitems` route, with success and error handling in the browser.

## Steps

1. **Set up the web API**  
   The API is configured in `Program.cs` to serve static files and map default routes.

2. **Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files**  
   These files are located in the `wwwroot` directory:
   - `index.html`: Contains the to-do form and display table.
   - `site.css`: Styles the page and table.
   - `site.js`: Handles fetching and interacting with the API.

3. **Implement CRUD operations**  
   The Fetch API is used to communicate with the `/api/todoitems` endpoint:
   - `GET` fetches the to-do items.
   - `POST` adds a new item.
   - `PUT` updates an existing item.
   - `DELETE` removes an item.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app using the .NET CLI or Visual Studio.

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd <repo_directory>
dotnet run
